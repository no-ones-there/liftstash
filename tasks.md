# LiftStash - Tasks

## Design & UX Improvements

### Task List
- [x] Task 1: Add a toggle to track whether an exercise should track improvement as an increase or decrease in weight - useful for assisted exercises as you drop weight, resistence increases
- [x] Task 2: Have PRs automatically track the highest (or lowest value, if decreasing weight is set) recorded value on an exercise
- [x] Task 3: Have the option to create a new exercise be listed in the Program as you add exercises, without losing progress on creating the Program
- [x] Task 4: When an exercise is added to a program, the exercise needs to have an option to add the desired amount of reps and sets in it. This is usually understood before a workout is attempted
- [x] Task 5: Change the New Program UI to  ensure each drop-down box is clearly visible. Currently, it is pushed over to the side and not visible by the size of the New Exercise button. The New Exercise button can be much smaller.
- [x] Task 6: Move the options for the UI into a hamburger menu
- [x] Task 7: Add a history graphing option for each exercise - one graph that you can filter in and out exercises and see how things have changed over time
- [x] Task 8: Add the ability to edit or delete entries in workouts, exercises and programs, including the date (for workouts)
- [x] Task 9: Add the ability to have a workout be split tracking of left and right (in the case of Split Squats for example, where you work one leg out at a time)
- [x] Task 10: Add a Dark mode to the entire application, triggered by a dark/light toggle (with appropriate material design icon for the button) to the left of the Hamburger menu
- [X] Task 11: Readability of text elements and dropdowns is not great
- [X] Task 12: Split L/R exercise tracking boxes are not rendering within the size of the window
### Completed
- [x] Fixed Program->Exercise->Workout relationship model
